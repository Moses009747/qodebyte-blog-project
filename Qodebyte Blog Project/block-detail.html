            <p>One of the most prominent applications of AI in healthcare is in diagnostic imaging. AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable<br>proficiency in interpreting medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. They can identify anomalies and deviations that might<br>be overlooked by the human eye. This is particularly valuable in early disease detection. For instance, AI can aid radiologists in<br>detecting minute irregularities in mammograms or identifying critical findings in chest X-rays, potentially indicative of life-threatening <br>conditions.</p>
